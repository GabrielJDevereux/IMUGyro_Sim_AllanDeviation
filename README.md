Demonstrates an understanding of gyroscope noise characteristics by simulating Angle Random Walk (ARW), 
Rate Random Walk (RRW), and Bias Instability (BI) using a Python script. It also includes computing Allan 
Deviation and Euler integration in C++ and MATLAB, then analysing noise characteristics using MATLAB.
